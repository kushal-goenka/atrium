Anthropic shipped an excellent plugin primitive for Claude Code. It's incomplete for enterprises: no private mirror, no federation policy, no observability, no governance. Atrium is the thin, neutral control plane that fills the gap — **LiteLLM for plugin marketplaces**.

Point your team at one URL. Get a beautiful catalog, one-click install snippets, federation from public marketplaces, SSO, RBAC, and OpenTelemetry metrics.

## Why Atrium

| What enterprises need | What Anthropic's reference marketplace gives | What Atrium adds |
|---|---|---|
| A private mirror of approved plugins | Public catalog only | Self-hosted + federated, internal plugins live here |
| Policy on what devs can install | Anyone can add any URL | Role-aware allow-list, quarantine-by-default, CVE gating |
| Observability on plugin usage | None | OpenTelemetry traces + per-plugin install / command metrics |
| A human discovery UX | CLI text list | Searchable catalog with trust tiers, security signals, usage stats |
| White-labelled for your org | Anthropic-branded | `ATRIUM_ORG_*` env vars theme the whole UI |
| Compliance story | None | Immutable audit log, SBOM, signed releases, documented threat model |

## Quickstart (dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushal-goenka/atrium.git
cd atrium
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. A seeded catalog of ten realistic plugins across three trust tiers loads automatically.

## Quickstart (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

See [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) for Postgres, object storage, SSO, and OTEL configuration. For a hardened production deploy, walk the checklist in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md#hardening-checklist-for-operators).

## Use with Claude Code

Once Atrium is running, point Claude Code at it:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://atrium.yourcompany.com
/plugin install incident-commander@2.3.1
```

Atrium serves Anthropic's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` format unchanged. Anything that works in the public marketplace works here.

## Features shipped in the alpha

- **Browse** — faceted catalog with category chips, trust-tier filter, per-plugin usage, and review flags for plugins with security signals.
- **Plugin detail** — full Anthropic manifest rendered (commands, subagents, skills, hooks, MCP servers), one-click install snippet, sticky sidebar with usage metrics, provenance, and a live security-signals panel.
- **Federation** — ingest from git repos, HTTP URLs, or local uploads; three-tier trust model (`official` / `verified` / `community` / `internal`); quarantine-by-default for new plugins.
- **Admin dashboard** — operational stats, approvals queue, source health, immutable audit log, high-severity signals panel.
- **Add source** — server-validated form + Prisma-backed persistence; new sources appear immediately in the catalog.
- **White-label theming** — `ATRIUM_ORG_NAME`, `ATRIUM_ORG_SHORT_NAME`, `ATRIUM_ORG_LOGO_URL`, `ATRIUM_ORG_URL`, `ATRIUM_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `ATRIUM_PROPOSAL_URL`, `ATRIUM_ACCENT_HEX`. Theme without touching code.
- **Users** — role table (admin / curator / installer / viewer). SSO-backed invitations land in M2.

## What's coming next

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). The headline items:

- **M1** — real ingestion from git sources + Anthropic-compatible serving endpoints
- **M2** — OIDC/SAML, four-eyes approval, full RBAC
- **M3** — OpenTelemetry end-to-end, admin metrics page
- **M4** — policy engine, scanners, CVE gating, notifications
- **M5** — signed releases, SBOM, provenance, bug bounty

## Self-host checklist

Before a production deploy, complete the ops checklist in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md#hardening-checklist-for-operators). Highlights:

- TLS-terminating reverse proxy
- OIDC or SAML (don't rely on magic links in prod)
- Bootstrap admins via `ATRIUM_ADMIN_EMAILS`
- Enable four-eyes mode and CVE polling
- Configure OTEL export
- Postgres backup policy

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components) · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · Prisma 6 (Postgres / SQLite) · TypeScript strict · No shadcn dep, components are in-tree · Apache 2.0.

**Philosophy:** boring stack, obvious code. A platform engineer should be able to read and patch Atrium in an afternoon.
